This app was formerly called ``django-stripe-payments`` and has been renamed to
avoid namespace collisions and to have more consistancy with Pinax.

Pinax is an open-source platform built on the Django Web Framework. It is an
ecosystem of reusable Django apps, themes, and starter project templates.
This collection can be found at http://pinaxproject.com.

This app was developed as part of the Pinax ecosystem but is just a Django app
and can be used independently of other Pinax apps.
